[Title]
KasaController  
A set of PowerShell scripts to manage TP-Link Kasa devices.  
  
## Details
These scripts make working with the TP-Link Kasa smart home devices possible using PowerShell.  They are not complete by any means but the basis is there and they can be freely used and modified as necessary.  
  
## Credits
These scripts were all written by me, but they would not be possible without the work of others ahead of me.  Specifically, I would like to credit  
- Aleandre Dumont and his [tplink-cloud-api project](https://github.com/adumont/tplink-cloud-api)  
- Lubomir Stroetmann and Tobias Esser and their [tplink-smartplug project](https://github.com/softScheck/tplink-smartplug)  

## Instructions
Generally speaking, you should be able to infer the usage of the scripts by their names. Additionally, some specific details have been included in the comments in each script.  
If there are any questions, please reach out and I will be happy to help.
